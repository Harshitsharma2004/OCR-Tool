# OCR-Tool
The **OCR Tool** uses **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** (without external libraries) to extract text from images. Users can upload images, which are processed using the **Canvas API** for pixel data extraction. It's a simple, responsive solution for basic image manipulation and text extraction tasks.
